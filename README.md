# MercadoLibre's Ruby SDK

This is the official Ruby SDK for MercadoLibre's Platform.

## How do I install it?

       clone repository
       https://github.com/mercadolibre/ruby-sdk.git

## Using Bundler

Add it to your Gemfile:

    gem 'meli', '~> 1.0.2'

And then install

    bundle install

## How do I use it?

The first thing to do is to instance a ```Meli``` class. You'll need to give a ```clientId``` and a ```clientSecret```. You can obtain both after creating your own application. For more information on this please read: [creating an application](http://developers.mercadolibre.com/application-manager/)

### Including the Lib
Include the lib meli in your project

### Attention
Don't forget to set the authentication URL of your country in file lib/config.yml

```ruby
require 'lib/meli'
```
Start the development!

### Create an instance of Meli class
Simple like this
```ruby
meli = Meli.new(1234, "a secret")
```
With this instance you can start working on MercadoLibre's APIs.

There are some design considerations worth to mention.

1. This SDK is just a thin layer on top of an http client to handle all the OAuth WebServer flow for you.

2. There is JSON parsing. this SDK will include [json](http://rubygems.org/gems/json) gem for internal usage.

3. If you already have the access_token and the refresh_token you can pass in the constructor

```ruby
meli = Meli.new(1234, "a secret", "Access_Token", "Refresh_Token")
```

## How do I redirect users to authorize my application?

This is a 2 step process.

First get the link to redirect the user. This is very easy! Just:

```ruby
redirect_url = meli.auth_url("http://somecallbackurl", "AR")
```

This will give you the url to redirect the user. You need to specify a callback url which will be the one that the user will redirected after a successfull authrization process. 
The country code param (`"AR"`) is optional, it’s set to `"BR"` by default. Take into account that if you don’t specify this, it will only work if your MercadoLibre app is from Brazil.

Once the user is redirected to your callback url, you'll receive in the query string, a parameter named ```code```. You'll need this for the second part of the process.

```ruby
meli.authorize("the received code", "http://somecallbackurl")
```

This will get an ```access_token``` and a ```refresh_token``` (is case your application has the ```offline_access```) for your application and your user.

At this stage your are ready to make call to the API on behalf of the user.

#### Making GET calls

```ruby
params = {:access_token => meli.access_token}
response = meli.get("/users/me", params)
```

The response body will not be converted from json to Ruby hash

Look this simple way to resolve this:

```ruby
 #convert json into a ruby hash
resp_hash = JSON.parse response.body
puts resp_hahs["KEY"]
```

#### Making POST calls

```ruby
params = {:access_token => meli.access_token}

 #we are cool, the sdk will convert this body into json for you
body = {:foo => "bar", :bar => "foo"}

response = meli.post("/items", body, params)
```

#### Making PUT calls

```ruby
params = {:access_token => meli.access_token}

 #we are cool, the sdk will convert this body into json for you
body = {:foo => "bar", :bar => "foo"}

response = meli.put("/items/123", body, params)
```

#### Making DELETE calls
```ruby
params = {:access_token => meli.access_token}
response = meli.delete("/questions/123", params)
```

## I want to contribute!

That is great! Just fork the project in github. Create a topic branch, write some code, and add some tests for your new code.

Thanks for helping!
